# Project: NSFNet Inspired Encrypted Network

## Description
This project aims to create an NSFNet-inspired encrypted network, which is constantly updated and capable of securely transmitting end-to-end encrypted messages and videos. In the event of node compromise, the system will automatically eliminate the affected node and find alternative routes for information transmission.

## Installation
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed in your development environment.
2. Download the code components from the repository.
3. Create a folder on your system and add the downloaded components to it.
4. Open your preferred development environment and navigate to the folder containing the components.
5. Run the components in the following order:
   - **controllerserver**: This controls the network infrastructure.
   - **Nodes**: Start the nodes you want to use in the network.
   - **Clients**: Launch the client applications for sending and receiving messages.
6. Once the components are running, enter the address of the client you want to communicate with and specify the type of communication (text or video).
7. If sending text messages, type your message and press enter to send.

These steps will download, install, and configure the project for use in your environment.

## Usage
After installation, you can use the network to securely transmit messages and videos end-to-end. Follow the instructions provided during the installation process to initiate communication and utilize the network's capabilities.
